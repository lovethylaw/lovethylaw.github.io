A temporary judge is being initiated by
the presiding head judge at the Family Court.

"The Family Court is what is called a 'stereotypi-call' court," said the head
judge.

The temporary judge says, "I see, its calls are stereotypical like the other
courts, as serious as those from the Criminal Court, as the decisions are all
about people."

"No, my learned junior...", the head judge shook his head. "In the Family Court,
like everywhere else, it is important we do not discriminate using stereotypes."

The temporary judge nods vigorously, "Absolutely, stereotyping leads to a
misapplication of justice!"

The head judge replies in disappointment. "You're all wrong. Here, we use
the right *stereotypes* and make our *call* based on just them. The right
judgements only come from the right patterns."

Confused, the temporary judge asks, "What exactly do you mean by the 'right
judgment'?"

"The 'right' judgment is one that keeps your decisions from being reviewed and
appealed. Think of it like this. No one ever gets fired for buying IBM, safe and
predictable, even when it's wrong," answered the head judge.

"But shouldn't we consider each case on its details? What if the parties don't
fit in the typical molds?" the temporary judge ventures.

"That's the art." exclaims the head judge. "You have to pick the stereotype that
fits them best. 'Best' here means 'best for me', that I am not troubled at my
job. It's not my fault if they come across as clich√© -- it's their job to
convince me otherwise."

The head judge continues. "Stray from stereotypes, and your decisions are
begging to be appealed. If you are unable to play by these rules, I might as
well save you and I the trouble, and let you go now. I cannot be blamed for
being risk-averse."

The head judge pulls out a chart, labeled "Stereotypical Outcomes Matrix," which
shows a complex grid of fathers and mothers with checkboxes for various traits
and expected rulings. He explains.

"If dad wears a tie and mom bakes cookies, easy -- the mother doesn't work and
is therefore a committed housewife that presumably spends all the time taking
care of the children -- custody to the mother."

"If dad's a musician and mom's a CEO? Also easy -- the mother is the breadwinner
and the children will be best being with the able party -- custody to the
mother."

"Both parents don't work? Simple -- the mother and children must have a closer
bond, and seeing a father with no motivation is bad -- custody to the mother."

As the head judge walked away, the temporary judge muttered to himself, "Maybe
I should sign up for a court on 'Advanced Stereotyping'..."
