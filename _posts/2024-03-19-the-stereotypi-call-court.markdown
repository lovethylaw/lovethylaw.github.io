In the corridors of the Family Court, a temporary judge is being initiated by
the presiding head judge.

The head judge begins, "The Family Court is what I call a 'stereotypi-call' court."

The temporary judge says, "I see, its judgements are as serious as those from
the Criminal Court, since they are all about people!"

"No, no, no...", the head judge shook his head. "In the Family Court, like
everywhere else, it is important we do not discriminate using stereotypes."

The temporary judge nods vigorously, "Absolutely, stereotyping can lead to a
misapplication of justice!"

The head judge replies in disappointment "You're all wrong here. Here, we use
the right *stereotypes* and make our *call* based on just them. The right
judgements only come from the right patterns."

Confused, the temporary judge asks, "What exactly do you mean by the 'right
judgment'?"

The head judge explains, "The right judgment is the one that keeps your
decisions from being appealed and your name off the unemployment list. Think of
it like this -- no one gets fired for buying IBM. It's safe, predictable."

"But shouldn't we consider each case on its details? What if the parents break
these typical molds?" the temporary judge ventures.

"That's the art." exclaims the head judge. "You have to pick the stereotype that
fits them best. Best here means best for me, that I don't lose my job. It's not
my fault if they come across as a clich√© -- it's their job to convince me
otherwise."

"Stray from stereotypes, and your decisions are just begging to be appealed.
Honestly, if you can't play by these rules, I might as well save you the trouble
and let you go now."

The head judge pulls out a chart, labeled "Stereotypical Outcomes Matrix." It's
a complex grid of fathers and mothers with checkboxes for various traits and
expected rulings. He explains.

"If dad wears a tie and mom bakes cookies, easy -- the mother doesn't work and
is therefore a committed housewife that presumably spends all the time taking
care of the children -- custody to the mother."

"If dad's a musician and mom's a CEO? Also easy -- the mother is the breadwinner
and the children will be best being with the able party -- custody to the mother."

"Both parents don't work? Simple -- the mother and children must have a closer
bond, and seeing a father with no motivation is bad -- custody to the mother."

As the head judge walked away, the temporary judge muttered to himself, "Maybe
there's a seminar on 'Advanced Stereotyping' I can sign up for..."
