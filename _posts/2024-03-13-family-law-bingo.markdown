This is the "Family Law BINGO" table, providing commonly used (rather
inflammatory) phrases in family law correspondence.

| B | I | N | G | O |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| utterly unrealistic | total disregard | blatant disrespect | gross negligence | deliberate manipulation |
| complete indifference | egregious misconduct | severe emotional abuse | persistent noncompliance | unreasonable demands |
| willful obstruction | calculated cruelty | unapologetic arrogance | systematic alienation | unjustifiable hostility |
| blatant favoritism | brazen dishonesty | manipulative tactics | unrelenting harassment | shocking irresponsibility |
| apparent insincerity | unfounded accusations | inexcusable neglect | divisive and destructive | callous disregard |

Here's how you play it:

1. Each player gets to choose a piece of correspondence from a defined set.
2. For each listed phrase, mark an "X" on the cell.
3. Whoever gets 5-in-a-row horizontally, vertically or diagonally, calls out
"BINGO".

"BINGO!" for family law fun -- a game for everyone in the firm!
