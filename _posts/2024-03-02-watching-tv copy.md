A family court judge is close to retirement age but feels uneasy.

His son asked, "Dad, you love your work and you've been working hard for years. Isn't it a good time to enjoy yourself in retirement?"

The judge replied, "Well, where can I find replacement for all the daily drama?"

"I might need to start watching TV!"
