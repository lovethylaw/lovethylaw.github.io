"Excuse me partner... It appears that the client is... lying?" the associate asked.

"Tell me about it."

"The facts don't seem to add up in her sworn testimony. She said that he beat
her on Monday at home and showed photos claiming injury... but he was already
lying in bed at the hospital on Sunday, and has not been conscious since."

"Oh. He was pretending to be unconscious, but actually went home to attack her
and then sneaked back to the hospital and continued lying down undetected."

"I'm confused. Did you really know that? Don't we need to find out?" the
associate was in awe of the narrative.

"Goodness, we're lawyers not detectives. There's no truth but only perspectives.
There is her truth, his truth, and then our truth. Our truth follows whoever
pays us. Who pays our fees?"

"She does."

"A lawyer is a good gymnast. We are paid on our ability to mentally twist, turn
and spin around to arrive at the right place!"
