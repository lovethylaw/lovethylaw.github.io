There was once a landmark judgement that says:

"the decision on custody does not depend on resolving factual disputes."

The judge was asked by a reporter friend of his thoughts, on this seemingly
contradicting statement.

He replied.

"Well... the truth doesn't pay my salary, does it?"

## Explanation

ML v YJ [2008] HKFLR 88

* "for the purpose of determining the question of custody, it is common ground that this Court does not need to resolve the factual disputes."
