Lao Tzu in the Dao De Jing once said about the way of the Tao:

[為無為，事無事](https://ctext.org/dictionary.pl?if=en&id=11654)

"to act without acting; to conduct affairs without catering"

Such sets the wise behavior of the family court judges who always goes with
the (stronger) flow:

Respondent refuses to follow the court order.

Judge: "Then let's cancel the order since it is clearly unrealistic."

Respondent demands the Plaintiff to "provide a private chef that only cooks with
organic ingredients and Le Cruset cookery 4 meals a day for the family and 5
unknown guests".

Judge: "Plaintiff, of course you don't need to do this in principle. But... why
can't you just consent to the demands?"
