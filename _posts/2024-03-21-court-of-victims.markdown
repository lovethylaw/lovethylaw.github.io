A lawyer, new to the Family Court, was told that the nickname of the court
is the "Court of Victims".

The lawyer asks his senior, whispered to a seasoned colleague, "Why do they call
this place the 'Court of Victims'?"

The seasoned lawyer leaned back and smiled. "In the Family Court, everyone is a victim:
The parents claim to be victims of each other;
the children are victims of their circumstances.
"

"I get it, but we the lawyers are surely not victims?", the new lawyer
asked confusingly.

"We certainly are victims of endless paperwork and headaches. And all the
dramatic stories that we don't care about!"

"And the judge?" the new lawyer asked curiously.

"Oh, the judge is the biggest victim of all...

"Forced to listen to everyone's nonsense all day long with a fixed pay, and
only to go home and realize that his own family won't listen to him for even
five minutes!"
