An associate was worried about technology developments especially with AI.

"Boss, do you think technology will obsolete our profession? You know we charge by hour but AI makes it so much faster."

"To the contrary my son! We just need to change to charging by word."

"Imagine the efficiency of our firm sending letters by computer, the opponent sends them back by computer, and the back and forth of a month of correspondences can be done in a minute!"

"All without a human touch. Imagine the revenue!"
