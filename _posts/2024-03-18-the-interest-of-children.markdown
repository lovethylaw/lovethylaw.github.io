In our trade, everything is for the best interest of children.

No, we don't actually care about our client's children. It is just language we
use to justify practically anything that happens. Everyone in the industry laps
it up as truth, believe it or not. It is the magic word that justifies
everything.

"The mother gave the children sweets instead of normal food for breakfast? Yes
she sacrificed for blame for the interest of children!"

"The children were left alone in the house? Yes she sacrificed her together time
for the best interest of the children!"

"They didn't go to school? Yes she sacrificed her duty in the best interest of
the children!"

"They starved to death? Oh my, I'm sorry to hear... but the mother sacrificed
her loss in the children's best interest!"
