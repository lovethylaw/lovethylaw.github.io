"Oh no, our client crashed the car against the divorcing husband who couldn't
stand her! He's now in hospital!" cried the associate.

"The client said he was holding the children hostage with a knife, she tried to
save the children but the car lost control and crashed into him." said the
partner.

"But the bystanders and police said he was just walking when she crashed into
him, there were no children or knife?!"

"Then maybe there was a UFO and the UFO had her car under control and crashed
into him."

"??!!!?"

"As long as the lie is big enough, people won't doubt it!"
