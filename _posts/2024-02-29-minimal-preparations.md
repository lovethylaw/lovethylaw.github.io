A family court judge is known to make minimal preparations for court hearings.

His assistant asks, "Your honor, you must be so wise and intelligent to make
your decisions without needing to cut through the crap of bundles!"

The judge said,

"Indeed! God granted me wisdom that comes so naturally. It's very simple..."

"Just like in a family, whoever is more difficult, wins."

"Otherwise, I can't deal with them, can I?"
